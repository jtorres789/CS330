1How do I approach designing software?
    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      the ability to create 3d objects, as the goal of the course.
    What design process did you follow for your project work?
      I went with bucket design, all same functions neatly in one place.
    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
      I would maitain the same organized structure so I can easily fix any issues by knowing where things are.
2How do I approach developing programs?
    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      Patience. In all seriousness, I used coded one function at a time, to understand what was inpacting my program.
    How did iteration factor into your development?
      I guess it helped by seing thew issues first hand?
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
      trying to make it. it was a challenge at some points, but it went better and better until i was able to make it. 
3How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
      now I know, wich areas I need to work on and study more, and how to approach problems.
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
      rendering ghraphics can help deign product and see a close approximation of the end product itself, thus finding potential issues before the build phase.
